# Vividus

Bulk preview images to decide which to import or ignore

## Motivation

Vividus is intended to help look at a large number of images and quickly mark which ones to import or filter, as well as to help sort for later sharing.  This came about as when I take photos, I may take ~1500+ images in a single event with the intent that I only want to save the "good" photos which are maybe 10% of this.  I want a means of looking at all the photos and marking ones worth importing.

Second use-case, as I go through images I want to sort some of say a specific person so I can later create a folder and upload those images for the person to share.
